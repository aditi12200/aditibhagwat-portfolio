    "bio":"Hey there, you! üíú I like to think of myself as 'just a girl growing her wingsüßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,' as my Instagram bio says. Why you ask? That's because I've always been someone who contributes everything she has to anything she does, especially while learning anything new. People describe me as a singer, dancer, artist, early riser (which I am extremely proud of, hehe) and a very curious person. I am a firm believer in dance's ability to cure one's soul. I‚Äôm also currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science from NC State University. Here, my track is a mixture of Software Engineering and Data Science.",
